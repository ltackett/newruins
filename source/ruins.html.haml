  The Ruins are nestled into a 1 hectare rocky hillside amidst a large coconut plantation in front of the Pacific Ocean along the stunning Costa Chica of Oaxaca Mexico. There is ample clean water filtered thru the hillside from the lagoon behind. There are amazing trees and giant cactus mixed in with large climbable rocks. Ocean provides us with great waves for surfing, incredible diving location, fresh fish, lobster and seaweeds.

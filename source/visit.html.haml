  , an online listing of farms, hostels and more who invite volunteers to stay with them short-term in exchange for food and accommodation.
  Currently, we are at the campsite stage of development. So plan on sleeping in hammocks up in the trees in front of the beach, then starting our work day with the rising sun, and closing the day with food, drinks, fires and swimming.
  If that doesn't sound like a good time, then you should wait until we come to come visit us.

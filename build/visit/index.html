        New Ruins

      <p>
        One day in the future, distant cultures will explore the crumbling towers and lush gardens of our long-lost community and marvel. We are New Ruins.

        So you'd like to come visit?

      <p>
        Participation is paramount to our mission.
        We delight in few things more than making new friends and to get them participating in our life.
        In turn, we hope to inspire you in your own life.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a lot of work ahead of us and aren't open for paying guests. To find out how you can help, check out our
        <a href="http://www.helpx.net/host.asp?hostid=18492">HelpX account</a>
        , an online listing of farms, hostels and more who invite volunteers to stay with them short-term in exchange for food and accommodation.
        Currently, we are at the campsite stage of development. So plan on sleeping in hammocks up in the trees in front of the beach, then starting our work day with the rising sun, and closing the day with food, drinks, fires and swimming.
        If that doesn't sound like a good time, then you should wait to come visit us.

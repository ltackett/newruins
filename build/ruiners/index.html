      <p>
        We are three friends from unique backgrounds and with a common vision. Nobody ever thought we would start a hostel and permaculture project on the beach in Mexico, except for us. This is our shared passion and our home together.

        Dagen, Nic's cousin, shares the same hippie childhood experiences, but choose more of an engineering path. The son of a fruit tree expert is now the lead builder of New Ruins. He has been building for as long as he can remember. Everything from houses, to outhouses; solar systems for farms to double decker bikes.
        Pictured above with the love of his life, his daughter Marely Mayapple. Dagen's enthusiasm for life, New Ruins, and even the most mundane things is evident after a quick conversation with him.

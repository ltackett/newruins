        One day in the future, distant cultures will explore the crumbling towers and lush gardens of our long-lost community and marvel. We are New Ruins.

      Ahhhh Poop!

  Well so everybody has to poop. We all know that. But where does yours go and why? So often people forget about these details or lose prespecitve on why these decisions have already been made. I grew up with a dry toliet. Others with water using toliets. This mentality at an early age sets the tone for what the individual finds appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  Did you know that an average house in american uses 20% of its water flushing toliets. Near the coast fresh water is usually a scarce resourse. Here at Venado we are in a unique sitiuation, due to our position to the laguna and the lack of inhabitants, and therefore competition. Either way we believe that composting our bodily waste and using it as fertilizer is preferible to the alternative of storing it in a concret box closed off from reentering the bioshere.
</p>
<p>
  We have broken ground on our first composting toliet.

  Well in spanish is Poso, and we got one now. It is a 5 inch tube jammed 9 meters into the ground (sand). The tube has little slits all in it and gravel is filled in around the tube. It cost less than 500 USD with materials and labor. So the lagoon water filtering thru the mountain then hits all sand and comes out very clean. The locals tell me that we will have unlimited sweet water, mas dulce que garafon. And yes i drank Mexican Well Water; which funny enough is a cocktail invention of my father, it consists of Tequila and unfiltered apple juice/cider.
</p>
<p>
  Water represents a big first step. I don't have a pump or a water storage tank yet, but they are on order. Having cleaning water enables so much. We can spend more time there working, and the time we go spend will be more comfortable and productive. We can start watering the existing thirsty plants and start planting new ones. We can cook better and cleaner. We can refresh ourselves after working, pictured above is the first shower. We are all very excited about this first step.

    Above we are celebrating our access to the rights to use the land behind us on Venado beach. Elena, Fernando, Angela, Nic and Majo champagne in hand and history in the making.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its been a long and arduous process to get here. But here starts the beginning to a new era for all of us here at New Ruins. It could have maybe been faster or more decisive, but we are in mexico so we didn't do it that way. A lot of time spent looking at many small beaches and the communities around them. Flip-flopping, back pedaling, talking ourselves or oneself in a circles; we've tried it all. But alas we have arrived, Home. For those of us who were bored sitting there with their engines running, now find themselves in front of a giant slab of stone waiting to be sculpted.
  </p>
  <p>
    But without further blah blah blah, let me show you what we are working with

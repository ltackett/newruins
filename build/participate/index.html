        Participation is paramount to our mission.
        We delight in few things more than making new friends and to get them participating in our life.
        In turn, we hope to inspire you in your own life.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a lot of work ahead of us and aren't open for paying guests. To find out how you can help, check out our
        <a href="http://www.helpx.net/host.asp?hostid=18492">HelpX account</a>
        , an online listing of farms, hostels and more who invite volunteers to stay with them short-term in exchange for food and accommodation.
        Currently, we are at the campsite stage of development. We have hammocks up in trees and tents down in the shady palms. We start our working day with the rising sun, most of us are up (or still up) before sunrise. A little rest in the afternoon and work in the evening. We like to close the day with a song, food, drinks, a fire, swimming.
      </p>
      <p>
        We might look like we have it together, but seriously we need and welcome help. We are just three people, but with your help we can all accomplish so much more. Especially design projects and art installations. Have a design? We'll help you realize it. Or show up and help us with one of ours.
